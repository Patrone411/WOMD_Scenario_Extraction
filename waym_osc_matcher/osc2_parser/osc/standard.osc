    crossing: crossing                                      # Mandatory: The crossing that is connected to the specified lanes
    start_lane: lane                                        # Mandatory: The lane where crossing starts (starting from the centerline of the lane)
    end_lane: lane                                          # Mandatory: The destination lane where the crossing ends (ending on the centerline of the lane).
    start_s_coord: length                                   # Mandatory: The crossing origin derived from a s-position along the centerline of start_lane.
    start_angle: angle                               # Optional: The angle at which the straight centerline of the crossing originates from the start lane. Default is perpendicular.

modifier map.routes_are_opposite:
    route1: route                                           # Mandatory: The first uni-directional route.

    lateral_overlap: lateral_overlap_kind                   # Mandatory: Specifies if the routes overlap lateral, meaning they become a single two-way lane.

modifier map.set_map_file:
